Be careful! The ground is very slippery and the walls are very bouncy so it is difficult to control your movements.

I plan on keeping the scope simple as the gameplay style makes the game difficult enough to keep engaged. 

Adding more levels can be done easily after creating a level editor for the game.

**The TA Parisa said in the tutorial that we could get our 2d textures from online so I hope this is okay
