Be careful! The ground is very slippery and the walls are very bouncy so it is difficult to control your movements.

I plan on keeping the scope simple as the gameplay style makes the game difficult enough to keep engaged. 

Adding more levels can be done easily after creating a level editor for the game.


Link To WebGL Build: The Movement seems to be slower in the webGL version of the build and made it a bit buggy sometimes.
I don't know what causes that but it is not like that in Unity

**The TA Parisa said in the tutorial that we could get our 2d textures from online so I hope this is okay
