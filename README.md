# Game Engines A3

### DESCRIPTION:	
In this game you will attempt to climb up a tower of grass platforms by jumping up.

Be careful! The ground is very slippery and the walls are very bouncy so it is difficult to control your movements.

There is a level creator which allows you to place different sized platforms and grass decoration around the level. You can save the level when completed and you
can load into the level to play it yourself! Simply click the Save Level button to save, and the Load Level Button to try it out!

After completing your own level you will have an option to play again or to create another new level.
